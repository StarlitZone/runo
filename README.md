# Welcome to RUNO

RUNO is a browser-based multiplayer online game modeled after the popular card
game UNO. I built this project in order to get additional hands-on practice
covering the new skills I have developed thus far while working through the
[Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](http://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)
and
[Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](http://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) programs offered by
[Udacity](http://www.udacity.com).
I hope you enjoy!
